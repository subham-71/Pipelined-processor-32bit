We have implemented a simple 32-bit processor that supports basic arithmetic and logical operations and is able to store and fetch data efficiently from a bank of registers with the help of a 5 stage instruction execution cycle.

The instruction execution cycle is as follows: 
   1. Instruction Fetching
   2. Decoding Instruction
   3. Executing and finding address to store the result
   4. Accessing Memory where result is to be stored
   5. Writing in the register
   
Our processor performs the following operations:
   1. Addition
   2. Subtraction
   3. Multiplication
   4. And
   5. Or
   6. Data Loading
   7. Data Storing
   8. Compare two numbers
