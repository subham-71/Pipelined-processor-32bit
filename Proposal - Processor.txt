OVERALL OBJECTIVE
We would like to implement a simple processor that supports basic arithmetic and logical operations and is able to store and fetch data  efficiently from a bank of registers.
IMPLEMENTATION
It will be implemented as RTL in verilog.
FUNCTIONALITY
1. We will be storing 32-bit data in a bank of registers using a type of encoding which contains information about the type of operation , operands and address (where the result will be stored), in one register.
2. Then we will be performing operations on this stored data using the instruction execution cycle which is as follows: 
   1. Instruction Fetching
   2. Decoding Instruction
   3. Executing and finding address to store the result
   4. Accessing Memory where result is to be stored
   5. Writing in the register
3. Our processor will be performing the following operations:
   1. Addition
   2. Subtraction
   3. Multiplication
   4. And
   5. Or
   6. Data Loading
   7. Data Storing
   8. Compare two numbers
