OVERALL OBJECTIVE
We would like to implement an encrypted password based lock system in verilog.

IMPLEMENTATION
It will be implemented as RTL in verilog. We will be using all the basic components like mux,flip-flops,counter,comparator etc in the project.

FUNCTIONALITY
1. The original key to the lock would be stored in an encrypted format.
2. The system will be taking input password from the user.
3. Then it will decrypt the original password and match it with the user input one by one.
4. It will be checking the input sequentially and would raise alert if some of the bits are not matching while giving input.
5. Finally if all the bits match, then it will give access.
6. After an unsuccessful attempt, one needs to press a reset button so as to take a new input.
